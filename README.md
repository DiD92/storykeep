Hello and welcome! If you are someone who likes to write to pay the bills or simply because you love it, I'm sure you've faced more than one the issue of keeping your different story revisions properly and also you wished there was an easy way to compare between them, well you are in luck, **storykeep** is a VCS (Version Control System) designed specifically for people like you!

The project is still in development but this are the main features it aims to provide once complete:

* Version control at four different levels: file, chapter, paragraph and phrase.

* Ability to keep a history of your changes in those four different levels.

* An easy way to compare changes between branches.

* Heuristics to merge changes between brances.
